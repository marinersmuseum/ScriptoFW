ScriptoFW
=========

Enables side-by-side (viewer and editor), full-browser-width Scripto transcription in Omeka

This was designed for a mod'ed Seasons Theme, but it might work for your theme as well, as the CSS is not theme-specific.

To-do list:
- Add CSS3 transition to width change on viewer
- Recenter OpenLayers map automagically after show/hide transcription
