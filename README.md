ScriptoFW
=========

Enables side-by-side (viewer and editor), full-browser-width Scripto transcription in Omeka

This was designed for a mod'ed Seasons Theme, but it might work for your theme as well, as the CSS is not theme-specific.

To-do list:
- Fix responsive positioning of admin edit box
- Recenter OpenLayers map automagically after show/hide transcription
- Try this on current Library theme
